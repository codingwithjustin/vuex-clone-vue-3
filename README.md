## Summary

Do we still need Vuex? Vuex is an awesome state management library. It's simple
and integrates well with Vue. But the new composition API in Vue 3 exposes the
underlying reactivity system and introduces new ways for structuring our
applications. The new reactivity system is so powerful that it can be used for
centralized state management.

Today we are going to be using the composition API to create our own state
management store similar to Vuex. Then at the end of the video, we will compare
the differences between the two solutions to determine which one you should use
in your application.
